# Panorama Stitching
- ## Dataset 
	- for set of continous images for stiching we used this [IIIA Dataset](http://www.iiia.csic.es/~aramisa/datasets/iiiapanos.html)
- ## Source Code
	- most part of the code was implemented in matlab
	- code is available in `src/make_panorama_channel.m` `src/make_panorama.m`
	- `make_panorama_channel.m` Genertes panorama for given sequence of RGB channel images
	- `make_panorama.m` Generates panorama for given sequence of single channel or grayscale images

- ## Results
	- results on test dataset are available in `results/`
	- some sample results are:
